# ESM Demo

In this repo you'll find a very basic example of the usage of ESM modules

## Instructions

- Fork this repo
- Clone your copy into your computer
- `cd` into the working directory
- Open the directory in VS Code
- From the file explorer on the left, select the `demos` directory
  - `basic-import-export`: This is the first example, where a file `app.js` imports objects defined in `math.js`
  - `import-re-export`: This is the second example, where a file `app.js` imports from an `modules/index.js` file that itself centralises exports from `modules/.js` and `modules/.js`
